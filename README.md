##Functional programming monads for CSharp

I develope it for experience and fun :)

### What is done
* `Maybe<T>` The Maybe monad embodies the strategy of combining a chain of computations that may each return `Nothing` by ending the chain early if any step produces `Nothing` as output. It is useful when a computation entails a sequence of steps that depend on one another, and in which some steps may fail to return a value.

### Examples
- Will be soon
